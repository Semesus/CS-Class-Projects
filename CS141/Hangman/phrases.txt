13
Through the cracks in the wall, 
slow motion for all
Dripped out of the bars
Someone smart said nothing at all
I'm watching TV, 
I guess that's the solution
they gave me a reciept and said I didn't buy nothin'
So rust is a fire 
and our blood oxidizes
my eyes roll around on the carpet
Oh hit the deck, it's the decal-man
standing upside down
and talking out of his pants.
